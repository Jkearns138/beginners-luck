<p> So I am starting on this course of coding.  I'm not sure if I can really do this but I'm going to try.  Somehow, in the 90s (yes I'm old)  I didn't learn html like everyone else.It was actually cool then to disect webpages and steal coding to make your own page.  I somehow managed to be uncool and not do that.  Anyway, here I am trying to learn to code.  Everything in the wisdom of the internets says that I should start with html and CSS.  As of right now, I get how boring this first project is.  I would like some insight into how to become a full stack developer. </p>
